## ape-weth-demo

A smol reference repo for using the [Ape](https://github.com/ApeWorX/ape) framework and a companion to this [Intro to Ape](https://snakecharmers.ethereum.org/intro-to-ape/) blog post.

For the sake of an example, this project includes the [WETH](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-wrapped-ethereum-weth-and-how-does-it-work) contract and tests its functionality.

### Quick start

-   `pip install eth-ape`
